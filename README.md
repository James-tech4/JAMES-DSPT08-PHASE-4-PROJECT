### Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis on Twitter

#### 1. Project Overview
In today's digital world, Twitter plays a key role in shaping public opinion and brand perception. This project develops an entity-level sentiment analysis model to classify tweets as Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant regarding a specific entity (e.g., brands, products, public figures). The goal is to help businesses extract actionable insights, track sentiment trends, and enhance decision-making.

#### 2. Problem Statement
Traditional sentiment analysis focuses on entire texts rather than specific entities within them. This project bridges that gap by building a model that identifies sentiment at the entity level, providing more precise insights for businesses.

#### 3. Objectives
* Improve brand and reputation management
* Enhance customer engagement strategies
* Enable data-driven decision-making
  
#### 4. Target Audience
* Businesses & brands
* Marketing & PR teams
* Customer support teams
* Investors & analysts
  
#### 5. Data & Preprocessing
* Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
* Preprocessing steps: text cleaning, stopword removal, lemmatization, tokenization, and label encoding.
  
#### 6. Modeling & Evaluation
Built two models:
* Logistic Regression (Baseline)
* Random Forest Classifier
Evaluated models based on accuracy, selecting the best performer for sentiment classification.

#### 7. Findings & Conclusion
The model with the highest accuracy ensures reliable entity-level sentiment classification, enabling businesses to monitor sentiment trends, improve customer experience, and strengthen brand perception.
